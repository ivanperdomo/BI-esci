Due to the fact that the information being processed and displayed by this program is confidential medical data, I have censored it for use in this GitHub repository. It is my hope that the functionality and use of the program is clear in spite of this.

Purpose and methodology:

The purpose of this program is to capitalize on underutilized medical data to improve patient care and maximize efficiency. The product was delivered as a lightweight, easy to use user-interface by which to access tailored business metrics.

The biggest hurdle when crafting this data solution was distilling the large amounts of data owned by the imaging center into a specialized, ready made database. This improves efficiency by compiling all the necessary data points beforehand so that real-time use of the program and its different options is fast and efficient. To overcome this problem, I queried the required components from the company database, performed the necessary transformations to prepare the data for use in different aspects of the product, and created an SQLite database with the output. This method drastically improves loading time and gives the user flexibility to choose different views and timelines without delay.

The UI was designed using Qt, a software development framework that facilitates rapid prototyping of easy to use User Interfaces. The whole project was written in Python.
